Chapter Conclusion


Summary of Main Findings:

A comprehensive evaluation was carried out on the enhanced or engineered geothermal systems. The panel found that a substantial increase in U.S. generating capacity could come from unconventional EGS resources such with enormous potential for primary energy recovery using heat-mining technology.

The analysis highlighted five major benefits, which are discussed further below",0.0,0.0,0.3042691946029663,tensor(0.7955),tensor(0.8183),tensor(0.8067)
