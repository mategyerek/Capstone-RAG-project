The rapidly declining cost is one main driving factor behind PV’s increased deployment, leading to various technical challenges as shown by several industry studies that analyzed both large-scale and small-size distributed generation. Although utilities have already started offering financial incentives towards customers who install solar panels in their homes (net metering), grid operators face new operational issues related the increasingly significant impacts on transmission systems [4].
