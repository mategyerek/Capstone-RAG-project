Question: What impact can PV integration have on utilities?
Answer (Partially incorrect): They may limit the installation or assign high costs for considering least-cost portfolios only, however in some cases this could improve reliability

Question: How do grid operators account for their costs?
    Answer. They allocate them on an incremental basis using cost allocation rates (CARs). 
   A regional transmission organization that uses CAR does this as follows:
A 10% weighted average of all customer base expenses can be allocated to the revenue pool, which then represents a proportionate portion attributable or otherwise for each individual Customer Service Agreement. In turn in these agreements there are an incremental amount charged per kilowatt-hour sold (at rate c).
