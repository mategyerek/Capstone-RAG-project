The lack of clarity surrounding regulatory authority over the location of facilities such as subtransmission towers is perhaps one area that illustrates this complexity.

Another limitation inherent in regional compact frameworks arises from an issue known simply “as”",0.0,0.0,0.3607354760169983,tensor(0.7992),tensor(0.8111),tensor(0.8051)
