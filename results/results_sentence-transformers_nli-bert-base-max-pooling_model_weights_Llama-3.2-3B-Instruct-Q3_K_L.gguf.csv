    The spark plug is not used to generate electricity but is used as an electrode to initiate electrical discharge by the combustion of air-fuel mixtures. In a typical automobile, the spark plug is operated at a voltage of approximately 2,000 to 25,000 volts and a current of approximately 100 milliamps. The energy contained in a spark of 2,000 to 25,000 volts at 100 milliamps can be calculated using the energy formula E = (1/2)AV^2, where V is the voltage, A is the current, and E is the energy in joules.
