       Drilling cost index (DCI) is the ratio of the actual cost of drilling for oil to an index value (which is typically 100) of what the cost would be if there was no shortage or surplus in the world oil supply.

       The calculation is based on the average of daily Brent prices for crude oil for the past year (or the average for a given period in the past).
