    Answer: Utility-scale PV plants integration in power systems (to make grid codes and market mechanisms more reliable).  → Not correct.
   - Another example of the importance is not directly mentioned but it's widely known:
        Grid reliability must be maintained when integrating variable renewables such as solar or wind.

      The accurate real-time estimation should ensure that these generators have ""adequate headroom"" to respond effectively during grid disturbances. 

    Correct: Aiming at maintaining adequate resources on reserve and ensuring sufficient capacity in power plants.

Note that the text only provides percentage values for hydro and nuclear energy in each scenario but not a comprehensive list of other fuel types or their respective percentages across all six scenarios.
    
     Given context is enough to answer this question since it states ""All electricity demand options have natural gas enjoying its major share."" Therefore, we can confidently state:
    Answer: The mix includes Hydro (40-60%), Nuclear power (32% -15%) and Natural Gas.
