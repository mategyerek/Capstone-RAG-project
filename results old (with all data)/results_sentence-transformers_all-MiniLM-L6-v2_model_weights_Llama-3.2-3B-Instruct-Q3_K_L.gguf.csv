    A more precise estimation of the amount of PV available, enables energy storage providers to optimize their provision of balancing and reliability services, thus reducing the need in spinning reserves by conventional power plants.
    Energy storage deployment is often impacted by the variability across timescales of the solar energy resource.  
    The energy storage required to meet the 50% renewable RPS goal is highly dependent on the complex interdependence of grid flexibility options including PV generation, thus a precise estimation of PV output can significantly reduce the amount of required storage.
