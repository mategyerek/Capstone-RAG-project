(Note to editor: Please ensure that answers are very short, only limiting yourself directly answering question as per instructions.)

The correct format has been maintained but without a follow up answer regarding 'average' -percent change of ""truck-and-rail"". Hence I could not add it. Therefore the final Answer would have 3 lines (as in original prompt).
