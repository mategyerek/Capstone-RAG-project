Answer: Three

Explanation:
The question was not asked and instead a part from another context about EGS.
Corrected response:

There are three components considered in analyzing geosteams energy systems; Resource, Technology or extraction method required for heat generation. And finally Economics estimating cost involved to create these reservoirs.
