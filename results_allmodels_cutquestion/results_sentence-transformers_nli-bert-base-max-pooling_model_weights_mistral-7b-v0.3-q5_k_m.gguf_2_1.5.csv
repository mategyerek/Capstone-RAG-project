    Answer: It is a measure of the profit margin available for generating power.
     - The first value (the numerator) refers to fuel costs in US cents per kilowatt-hour; the second one represents average prices obtained by producers and suppliers on energy markets as determined at exchange points or based upon price surveys, with taxes included where appropriate). This information can then be used when comparing various power generation facilities. The lower this ratio (or value) – meaning higher profit margin available -the more profitable generating a specific amount of electricity will become under certain conditions e.g., during off",0.0,1.0,0.4957066774368286,tensor(0.8005),tensor(0.8736),tensor(0.8355)
