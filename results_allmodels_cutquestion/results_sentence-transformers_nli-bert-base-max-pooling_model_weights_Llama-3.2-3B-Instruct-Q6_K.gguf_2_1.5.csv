#

The chapter on theories & methodologies discussed several alternatives to the conventional flow-based model. For example:


### Modeling EGS Reservoirs

One approach was a numerical modeling alternative using three-dimensional finite difference simulations (3D-FDS), which use mathematical algorithms based for describing dynamic behavior of fluids within reservoir systems.
