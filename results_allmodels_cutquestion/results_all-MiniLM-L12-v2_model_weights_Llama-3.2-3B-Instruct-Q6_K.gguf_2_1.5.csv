Chapter 2 Synopsis and Executive Summary

Synopsis: 

Executive summary:

Geothermal systems, including Enhanced Geothermal Systems (EGS), have shown remarkable potential as a primary energy source due to their large capacity. EGS is developed from existing volcanic rocks by applying high temperatures which enhances its ability of the thermal fluid reservoir in that rock formation through chemical stimulation processes such as injection and/or fracturing or grinding process using tools, machines like drill pipes drilling bit heads.
