    Question: Who is responsible for managing power flow on a grid?
    
        Answer not provided in context
 

As I see it, this answer should indicate that an authority outside of ""KlassWilson"" and presumably related to Federal Regulation Commission (FERC).   Since we did provide the correct  information previously about former FERC Commissioner Joe Kelliher Discusses New Transmission.

The question regarding a cost-allocation approach of “pay-as-you-play” is raised. While pay-or-pay methods such as this can be beneficial, it would likely need to meet regulatory standards before approval could take place.

The chapter on theories & methodologies discussed several alternatives to the conventional flow-based model. For example:


### Modeling EGS Reservoirs

One approach was a numerical modeling alternative using three-dimensional finite difference simulations (3D-FDS), which use mathematical algorithms based for describing dynamic behavior of fluids within reservoir systems.
